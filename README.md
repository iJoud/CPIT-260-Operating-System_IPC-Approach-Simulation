# Operating-System_IPC-Approach-Simulation
The uploaded java project contain my assignment in operating systems course "CPIT-260". 
In this assignment, I coded a simulation for three different Inter Process Communication (IPC) approaches that processes in operating system use to exchange data.
The IPC simulated approaches:  
1. Shared Memory
2. Message Passing
3. Client-Server
